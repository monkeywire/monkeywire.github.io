For the better portion of my adult life I have stood in wonder as if I was on the Tardis steps gazing into the universe by the strength of mind. Perhaps this is why I gravitate toward security work so much.  Security is entirely about people, how they behave, think, and react.  It is a job of being aware of your soundings, what is happening and why it is happening. Human behavior and my own mind has led me many directions. during my life.

 I have read much material, listened and watched to lectures of a whole sort on the topic of mind, conscienceless, awareness, and spirit.  I have event attempted some simple mind experiments of my own and usually am in constant study of my own thoughts.  I have come to the conclusion though, as insightful as these experiments are, without a more structured and full approach I will never be able to achieve a better understanding.  It seem as though I have reached the point of diminishing returns on my understanding of mind.  This has spurred this entry, and in-fact this entire blog.

 This blog will be my tool to document such thoughts and experiments. Not only of my mind and people, but all the little projects, experiments, code, and other endeavors I chase.  I not only experiment mentally but chase a large pool of knowledge and skills.  I have learned an extraordinary amount in my life but so much of it gets lost in day to day living.

 If you find yourself reading this blog somehow, please feel free too.  I am writing this primarily for myself as a journal of sorts, however, I am always eager to hear other peoples opinions, thoughts, and insights and would look forward to a open forum to discuss a world of wonder.  Perhaps too some of these entries my help others experimenting or working on similar problems, as a way to give back to the people of the Internet of have given so much knowledge to the world.

 Thank You,
