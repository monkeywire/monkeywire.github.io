As a guide to mindfulness I will be listening to a serial of lectures by Professor Mark W. Muesse.  I do not intend his lectures to be the end all by all methods and guides for me to adopt.  Only as a road map for my own exploration of the subject matter.  As Professor Muesse explores a topic I my self will.  Professor Muesse has a laundry list of qualifications.

I don't feel it would help anyone to give them here.  I don't believe it entirely matters.  I know that he has explored the subject, and by following his logical progressions as a road map only, we will only be leaning on his experience in the topic, not necessarily his findings.

The Professor believes that if we examine ourselves we will find that much of the time our mind is wondering. He uses the example that many of us can relate to of sitting in a committee meeting. You may be in the committee meeting and half way listing and participating, but our minds tend to wonder. We think things like, when did she get that haircut, or I have to say something here to look good.  We may even start to wonder in thoughts like after this meeting I have that other meeting what do I need to bring to that...

The Professor also goes on to explain that when our mind is working we are typically thinking about past or future but rarely on the present.  You may want to take some time to ponder this.

I do find this true in my own life, and have known this for some time based on my own experiences.  Where I seem to fail is the natural question after that.  How can we stay more focused on what is happening in the here and now? I have worked on this problem for a long time.  I do find that the more I work on this the better I become at it.

I can sometimes almost feel a physical change in my "mind" when I start to drift in and out of the present.  As though my mind were some kind of time machine that I have no control over at times.  Almost as though when I loose control of this "time machine" I have the sensation for a moment of falling of a cliff.  Of course, I don't always get this feeling, I'm not nearly that mindful of what my mind is doing, but sometimes, if I'm lucky, I can catch it.  So, once again back to the question, how best do I "train" my mind.

Many ancient cultures, past or current religions of the world, and metaphysical groups have struggled with this question since the begging of time.  It is not my intention to get into the spiritual with these experiments, however, it seems at times this may become unavoidable.  At sometime I am sure I will need to confront my own spirituality.  I am sure of this for one reason.

Many have theories on what conciseness and mind are.  Some say it is a community of thought shared between all, some say it is a illusion, theories are everywhere.  What I do know is that the greatest breakthroughs in human history come from some of the most "insane" theories.  Perhaps, just maybe mind and conscientiousness come from the soul.  I know many will scorn at this, but it is a crazy idea.  It is a idea that would coincide with many religions and cultures of the world have thought.

Science has tried to leave spirituality behind, claiming it to have no basis in reality.  Once we do thins suddenly we are left with these questions we are pondering here.  But, if we say science might just have it wrong, perhaps we do have souls things start to make sense again.  So what is the soul?

I can't say for sure my self.  All the time in science we make things up as hypothesis to explain other things, think dark matter, atoms, etc.  We can latter find that these hypothesis were only partially correct or wrong, but by only by using theme to explain certain things we otherwise could not explain we came to the answer.  So why throw out the soul when it helps explain so much, what proof do we have to discount it out of the gate?
