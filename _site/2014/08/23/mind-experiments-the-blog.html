				<section>
					<p>For the better portion of my adult life I have stood in wonder as if I was on the Tardis steps gazing into the universe by the strength of mind. Perhaps this is why I gravitate toward security work so much.  Security is entirely about people, how they behave, think, and react.  It is a job of being aware of your soundings, what is happening and why it is happening. Human behavior and my own mind has led me many directions. during my life.</p>

<p>I have read much material, listened and watched to lectures of a whole sort on the topic of mind, conscienceless, awareness, and spirit.  I have event attempted some simple mind experiments of my own and usually am in constant study of my own thoughts.  I have come to the conclusion though, as insightful as these experiments are, without a more structured and full approach I will never be able to achieve a better understanding.  It seem as though I have reached the point of diminishing returns on my understanding of mind.  This has spurred this entry, and in-fact this entire blog.</p>

<p>This blog will be my tool to document such thoughts and experiments. Not only of my mind and people, but all the little projects, experiments, code, and other endeavors I chase.  I not only experiment mentally but chase a large pool of knowledge and skills.  I have learned an extraordinary amount in my life but so much of it gets lost in day to day living.</p>

<p>If you find yourself reading this blog somehow, please feel free too.  I am writing this primarily for myself as a journal of sorts, however, I am always eager to hear other peoples opinions, thoughts, and insights and would look forward to a open forum to discuss a world of wonder.  Perhaps too some of these entries my help others experimenting or working on similar problems, as a way to give back to the people of the Internet of have given so much knowledge to the world.</p>

<p>Thank You,</p>
